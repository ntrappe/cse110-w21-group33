## Context and Problem Statement

As we are moving to the next phrase of the project, we need to have clearer group structure and guidelines for collaboration. How do we collaborate efficiently as the project is moving faster?


## Considered Options

* Pair programming
* Front-end - Back-end - Fullstack

## Decision Outcome

For sprint 1, we decided on pair programming.

### Positive Consequences

* More team engagement as members will meet with each other outside of the big group meeting time
* Tasks can be divided smaller
* Teams can check in on one another to ensure the quality of work
* Pairing one experienced member with one inexperienced member can help both learn better.

### Negative Consequences

* When teams starting to test each other codes, there is a potential of merge conflicts

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Pair programming
Team members will work in pairs to complete tasks assigned. 

* Good, because multiple teams can test the same feature for quality control
* Bad, because there might be a lot of conflicts when multiple teams work in the same feature.


### Front-end - Back-end - Fullstack
Group is divided into front-end, back-end, and fullstack subteam

* Good, because the responsibilities of each team member are clearer
* Bad, because leaders of subgroups need to be able to divide the tasks properly
