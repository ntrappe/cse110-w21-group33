# MVP Features

* Status: Accepted
* Deciders: Michael Donaldson, Richard Duong, Brandon Liu, Bryant Shao, Nicole Trappe, Vy Truong, Felix Zhang, Lulu Zhu
* Date: 2021-01-28

## Context and Problem Statement

What are the most essential aspects of a Pomodoro timer that even the most basic one should have? Essentially, what should be the initial features of the first iteration of the project (minimum viable product)?

## Considered Options

* Central timer with buttons
* Traditional vs customizable
* Manual vs automation
* Minimalist UI

## Decision Outcome

Chosen options:

* Central timer with buttons, because it’s an essential component to any Pomodoro timer
* Traditional Pomodoro technique, because it’s an easier goal to hit initially and gives us flexibility to add possible customization later
* Manual timer, because it’s an easier goal to hit initially and gives us flexibility to possibly add automation if wanted in later iterations
* Minimalist UI, because it’s better to focus on the core functionality before we add more features/design

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Central timer with buttons

* Pros: Essential feature of any Pomodoro timer, puts focus to main feature of the app
* Cons: ...

### Traditional Pomodoro technique

* Pros: Easier to implement on initial run, forced/strict format can be helpful to those with less self-control
* Cons: Less flexibility/customization for the user’s needs regarding break lengths, work session lengths, etc.

### Manual timer

* Pros: Easier to implement on initial run, gives user more freedom in timing themselves
* Cons: Less intuitive, requires that user knows what Pomodoro technique is, requires extra effort in enforcing the Pomodoro technique
