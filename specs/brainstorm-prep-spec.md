#### CONCERNS
- todolist might detract from time management
- should customization involve self-exploration or be prompted?
- gamification
- how to notify people of transition
  - audio can be annoying so have first-timers set it?
  - if a small window/widget should there be options to see timer vs progress bar (some ppl like explicit time, others find it distracting)
  - timer gets lost in tabs
- since sets are determined by Pomodoros, do we care how many breaks people miss? Should that be taken into account for the longer break?
- automation is a tough design issue
  - if auto: then we need to set a stop condition otherwise could keep running (e.g. Spotify runs all day, Netflix "are you still watching?"); assumes you will take the break
  - if manual: can be annoying/break flow, but it confirms you want to start working/take a break
- when starting session, should ask if want classic Pomo or to customize? Or let them explore customization in setting?
