"As an elementary school student, I can change how long the timer goes for so I can get through a cycle without getting distracted."

### Dylan: 
"As a procrastinating college student who studies outside of the house a lot, I can change the notification mode from sound to color change/pop-up so that myself and others around me aren't distracted by the sounds." 

### Bob: 
"As a blueprint designer, my team can't pause the timer, which actually helps us focus better because we will remain more focused on the task at hand if we know what the goal of each pomodoro is."

### Gillespie: 
"As a teacher, I can have my students use the provided infographic to help them understand this technique that I want them to use, saving me the time of doing so during class, and giving them a helpful reference at any time."
