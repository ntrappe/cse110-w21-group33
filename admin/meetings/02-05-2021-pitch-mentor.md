### Key Points
- target a diverse audience that have different needs related to productivity
- our features are intended to fulfill specific requirements from users, as seen in user stories
- presented UI layout and flow of the website
- showed future ideas for customization
- Sprint # 1 goal is to implement basic features of a normal pomodoro, color changing, and internal timer/break counting
- Sprint # 2 goal is to implement advanced customzation, notification type, time in tab window, save cookies
- Chad recommends documenting reasoning for features in user stories
- Presentation should be reformatted to ShapeUp format
- Karen persona can be reworked to be more specific/from parent's perspective
- Bob can be reworked to reflect a desire to get used to technology, but lacks familiarity (40-60 years old)
- User stories could be more comprehensive (each feature choice should be justified)
- Statistics page wasn't fleshed out in terms of UI
- Still need to decide on UI implementation of advanced features (icons and placement)
- tweaks to models to clarify levels/controls of the app
- keep ADR files updated consistently
- Divide sprint#1 goals into essential and preferable add-ons
- Chad suggests squashing commits to reduce number of menial commits (git squash)
