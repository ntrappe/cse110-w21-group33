### Agenda
1. Review group assignments including bonding event, contract, page, and video.
2. Receive advice/feedback from Chad regarding group structure and organization.

### Key Points
1. **Roles**: Think about roles that the sub-groups leaders will have, as well people who will be delegated to take care of more administrative team tasks.
2. **Leadership Structure**: Consider the relation between sub-group leaders and the leader(s) of the team as well. Make sure someone is assigned to take care of tasks like group assignments, administration stuff. An even playing field is fine, but the items need to be taken care of, dividing up between members is also fine.
3. **Next Week**: Have a group brainstorm session and begin thinking about the project + high-level ideas. Make sure to plan thoroughly before starting design. Have a team standup to make sure everyone gets started.
