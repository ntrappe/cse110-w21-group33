### Meeting

#### Agile
- **Issues** will be recorded in the [Issues](https://github.com/ntrappe/cse110-w21-group33/issues) tab of this repo
  - we will create specific labels to address the topic of the issue
  - issues will be "assigned" to the pair working on them
  - the group unanimously voted to use Github's internal Issues vs a 3rd party API
  - *note: we may want to create a specific template for these initial features*
- **Glossery**  will contain definitions of all the terms we'll be throwing around
  - it will have notes on specific verbage used in CSE 110 (e.g. ADR, server-side, MVP)
  - it should also include naming conventions of different UI elements (e.g. lightbox)
  - *note: Lulu is setting this up*
- **Coding Guidelines** will set a standard for how we will write code and make it easier for others to read/collaborate
  - currently, we are considering using Google's guide on HTML/CSS/Javascript
  - *note: Richard is deciding whether Google's guide is good enough (or an alt) and will add a small summary of key points*
- **Tools/Languages:**
  - we will be using HTML/CSS/Javascript
  - as of right now, we will not be using another other packages/languages
  - browser usage: 
    - Felix, Lulu, Bryant, Brandon, Vy, & Richard use `Chrome`
    - Nicole uses 'Safari' and primarily 'Firefox'
    - *note: this will be helpful when we test the website on different browsers*
  - tool version:
    - most common version of node is `14.15.4` 
    - other versions were `12.18.3` and `15.7.0`
  - **TODO**: determine which browser & node versions we will support

### Agenda
#### Agile
- set up backlog/issues
- set coding guidelines
- discuss the glossery
- determine which tools and languages we will use
  - what browsers to support
  - do we really need this/that library?
- review features with the *Five Whys*
   1. who does this benefit?
   2. what is the context?
   3. when would the answer work?
   4. where would the answer work?
   5. why is this a problem?
  
#### Design
- think about accessibility
  - do we want to include different languages
  - do we want to use mouse and key presses
    - does anything require more than just 1 finger?
  - how about for people that need hearing aids
  - colorblind people/need high contrast
  - older people need larger fonts
- wireframing
  - what is the flow of our site going to look like
  - how can the user interact
  - mock up story board
  
#### Pipeline
- split up work, potentially do as pair-programming
- set deadlines
- how are we keeping track of the status of work and who is doing what
- code review
- advanced testing
