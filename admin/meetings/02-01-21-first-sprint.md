### Meeting

#### Agile
- **Issues** will be recorded in the [Issues](https://github.com/ntrappe/cse110-w21-group33/issues) tab of this repo
  - we will create specific labels to address the topic of the issue
  - issues will be "assigned" to the pair working on them
  - the group unanimously voted to use Github's internal Issues vs a 3rd party API
  - *note: we may want to create a specific template for these initial features*
- **Glossery**  will contain definitions of all the terms we'll be throwing around
  - it will have notes on specific verbage used in CSE 110 (e.g. ADR, server-side, MVP)
  - it should also include naming conventions of different UI elements (e.g. lightbox)
  - *note: Lulu is setting this up*
- **Coding Guidelines** will set a standard for how we will write code and make it easier for others to read/collaborate
  - currently, we are considering using [Google's guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html) on HTML/CSS/Javascript
  - *note: Richard is deciding whether Google's guide is good enough (or an alt) and will add a small summary of key points*
- **Tools/Languages:**
  - we will be using HTML/CSS/Javascript
  - as of right now, we will not be using another other packages/languages
  - browser usage: 
    - Felix, Lulu, Bryant, Brandon, Vy, & Richard use `Chrome`
    - Nicole uses `Safari` and primarily `Firefox`
    - *note: this will be helpful when we test the website on different browsers*
  - tool version:
    - most common version of node is `14.15.4` 
    - other versions were `12.18.3` and `15.7.0`
  - operating systems:
    - Felix & Richard use `Windows`
    - Brandon, Bryant, Vy, Lulu, Nicole, & Richard use `Mac`
  - **TODO**: determine which browser & node versions we will support
  
#### Pipeline
- We had a unanimous decision to split the group into pairs to do pair programming
  - we will pair up a more experienced (i.e. has done web dev/has industry knowledge) person with a novice to balance out the team
  - each pair should schedule meetings to jointly code or discuss their work
  - each pair should log any issues in the [Issues](https://github.com/ntrappe/cse110-w21-group33/issues) tab and assign that issue to themselves
  - each pair will be assigned one feature at a time
  - each pair should rely on their partner to answer questions before reaching out to the group
  - each pair is responsible for setting their deadline, completing their work, and raising concerns to either Nicole, Chad, or Powell
- During the `Thursday @6pm` meetings, we will have a **check-in** wherein each pair will report the status of their work
  - if advice/user input/technical help is needed, this is the place to raise those concerns
- Each pair will set their own deadline
  - we will be using the Agile [story point/t-shirt](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation) system
    -  1-XSmall, 2-Small, 4-Medium, 8-Large, 16-XLarge
  - each deadline is unique to the feature being built and experience of the pair (*however, we will have rough overall deadlines each sprint*)
    - example: If a pair has experience building that specific feature, they may evaluate the task as a 2 because it shouldn't take too long

### Agenda
#### Agile
- set up backlog/issues
- set coding guidelines
- discuss the glossery
- determine which tools and languages we will use
  - what browsers to support
  - do we really need this/that library?
- review features with the *Five Whys*
   1. who does this benefit?
   2. what is the context?
   3. when would the answer work?
   4. where would the answer work?
   5. why is this a problem?
  
#### Design
- think about accessibility
  - do we want to include different languages
  - do we want to use mouse and key presses
    - does anything require more than just 1 finger?
  - how about for people that need hearing aids
  - colorblind people/need high contrast
  - older people need larger fonts
- wireframing
  - what is the flow of our site going to look like
  - how can the user interact
  - mock up story board
  
#### Pipeline
- split up work, potentially do as pair-programming
- set deadlines
- how are we keeping track of the status of work and who is doing what
- code review
- advanced testing
