### Agenda
- Brainstorm the Pomodoro app by discussing ideas such as basic features, intended problem to solve, target audience, etc.

---

### Key Points
- Reflected on Chad's discussion section and talked about details of overarching goal
  - What problems are we trying to solve?
    - Distractions, burnout, getting started, chunking up tasks
  - What differentiates our app from others?
    - Ideas included automation, gamification, satisfying to use, intuitive/accessible design
  - Who is our user?
    - Procrastinating college students doing complex assignments and large projects
- Discussed bare-bone features of the first iteration of app
  - Simple, minimalistic design
  - Timer, buttons for starting and restarting, title to determine if on Pomodoro, short break, or long break
  - Likely manual rather than automated
  - Little to no customization, closely follows Pomodoro Technique

### First Sprint (MVP)
- no automation, everything is manual
  - user must push button to start pomodoro and break
- traditional pomodoro
  - 25m pomo session, 5m short break, 30m long break
  - 4 pomos = set, long break comes after a set
  - user does NOT get to decide on the length of break (set as short or long)
- clear timer takes up screen
- UI is minimalist, focuses on count down, changes color depending on mode currently in
  - add small text labelling the mode (e.g. "short break")
- user input: start, restart

### Second Spring
- show the simplified time left in tab text (e.g. 24m NOT the seconds)
  - lets user see time remaining without having to switch back to that tab
- design the UI such that a very condensed, small window just shows off timer nicely
- add settings to allow user to modify length of time
  - put MINIMUMS and MAXIMUMS on this time: e.g. for pomo, min 15m, max 2h
  - also add settings for other simple UI changes (e.g. color, 24m vs 24m 03s)
- decide on notifications: audio/push/none?

### Future Spring
- record
  - tasks you were able to accomplish (like a did-list)
  - productivity ratings
  - #pomos completed
- notifications
- todolist
- gamification

### Hate These Features
- progress bar
- flashing, moving text, animations, distractions
- unstoppable sounds
- pause/stop button
- captcha
