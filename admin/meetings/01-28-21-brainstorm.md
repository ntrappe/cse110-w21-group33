### Agenda
- Brainstorm the Pomodoro app by discussing ideas such as basic features, intended problem to solve, target audience, etc.

---

### Key Points
- Reflected on Chad's discussion section and talked about details of overarching goal
  - What problems are we trying to solve?
    - Distractions, burnout, getting started, chunking up tasks
  - What differentiates our app from others?
    - Ideas included automation, gamification, satisfying to use, intuitive/accessible design
  - Who is our user?
    - Procrastinating college students doing complex assignments and large projects
- Discussed bare-bone features of the first iteration of app
  - Simple, minimalistic design
  - Timer, buttons for starting and restarting, title to determine if on Pomodoro, short break, or long break
  - Likely manual rather than automated
  - Little to no customization, closely follows Pomodoro Technique

### First Sprint (MVP)
- no automation, everything is manual
  - user must push button to start pomodoro and break
- traditional pomodoro
  - 25m pomo session, 5m short break, 30m long break
  - 4 pomos = set, long break comes after a set
  - user does NOT get to decide on the length of break (set as short or long)
- clear timer takes up screen
- UI is minimalist, focuses on count down, changes color depending on mode currently in
  - add small text labelling the mode (e.g. "short break")
- user input: start, restart

### Second Sprint
- show the simplified time left in tab text (e.g. 24m NOT the seconds)
  - lets user see time remaining without having to switch back to that tab
- design the UI such that a very condensed, small window just shows off timer nicely
- add settings to allow user to modify length of time
  - put MINIMUMS and MAXIMUMS on this time: e.g. for pomo, min 15m, max 2h
  - also add settings for other simple UI changes (e.g. color, 24m vs 24m 03s)
- decide on notifications: audio/push/none?

### Future Sprint
- record
  - tasks you were able to accomplish (like a did-list)
  - productivity ratings
  - #pomos completed
- notifications
- todolist
- gamification

### Hate These Features
- progress bar
- flashing, moving text, animations, distractions
- unstoppable sounds
- pause/stop button
- captcha

### Full Notes
**The Problem:**
- Using phones
- Life is full of distractions 
- App not distracting 
- Hard to get started (activation energy)
    - Tries to motivate you
- Avoid burnout, space breaks

**Our Goals:**
- improve flow in the future (Track flow)
    - Future integration 
- Let manually adjust duration of work + let them keep track of Pomodoros
- At end of session, get to see Pomodoros for that day/log them 

**How Our App Is Unique:**
- Automatically go to break 
    - (A) into short/long
    - (B) just into a break
- Automatic cycling for Pomodoro (vs timer on phone)
    - Feel a sense of urgency to go into the mode (not ignore it?)
    - If manual, take as long as you want
    - After break, if manual, don’t wanna go back into working
- Break issues
    - First iteration: just Pomodoro 
    - Give option later to auto cycle (time out function)
    - Or notification of “you done watching” sort of time out for forever loop
        - Goes against technique bc just wanna work + don’t want any interruptions
- todolist
    - Minimalist says no todolist
        - Probably not better than other ones out there 
        - Not helpful, clutters up the space
    - Write down after the Pomodoro of what you do (achievement)
        - Record of what you did
        - Satisfaction of completing info 
            - Keep engagement in website 
- Attractive
    - Want people to use app
        - Add game (like dinosaur network down)
        - Therefore diff than a todolist bc makes the break fun and keeps you on the site
    - Simple 
- Most Pomodoro apps not successful, want ppl to use app, monetize it/gamify it to keep people on
- Agile development

**Who Is The User:**
- Procrastinating college student 
- constraints: work day/time excluding lecture to usually get one big assignment done
- Both trying to solve small + large tasks
- Some people say it’s busy work
- Other people say high level stuff (chunking the project into sizable pieces)
    - Small assignments don’t require a break 
- Ppl use the app when at desk/online 
- Calendar is a constraint (time slots available for work)
