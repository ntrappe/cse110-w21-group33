### Part 1
Before you forgot them, list all your thoughts and creative ideas on the Pomodoro Timer we will build! Do you want to modify the technique? Do you have specific features in mind? Are there UI components you want to add?

*Think here*.

### Part 2
A bunch of random online Pomodoro timers have been listed. Please choose one you would like to study. It would be helpful if no more than 2 people did each timer so please add your name to the table below to indicate you have claimed it. Feel free to add another timer if there's one you'd rather study.

### Part 4 (Bonus)
Try the Pomodoro Technique for a day. The traditional Pomodoro Technique is defined as:
```
A Pomodoro is a work session that lasts for 25 minutes.
If a work session is interrupted or paused, it is forfeited.
After a Pomodoro, take a 5 minute break.
Once you have completed 4 Pomodoros--a "set"--take a longer break (15-30 minutes).
```

#### Data
1. How many Pomodoros did you do?
2. Did you cancel/forfeit any Pomodoros? Why?
3. How many short breaks did you take?
4. How many long breaks did you take?
5. How did you time yourself? (E.g. phone clock app or specific Pomodoro app)
6. What device did you use for this timer? (E.g. phone, laptop)

#### Experience
1. Did you initially plan how many Pomodoros you wanted to spend or did you wing it?
2. If you planned the number, was this challenging or easy?
3. Did you feel your productivity increased?
4. Did you use traditional 25 minutes or did you modify that (E.g. 35 minutes)?
5. Would you consider modifying the 25 minutes in the future?
6. Did you feel like you often skipped a break?
7. Did you often extend your break into a longer one?
8. Would you use this technique again?
