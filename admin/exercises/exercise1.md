# Exercise 1


### :tomato: &nbsp; INSTRUCTIONS
To get prepared for the brainstorming event, this exercise might help to organize your thoughts.
1. **Make a copy** and label it with your name. Example: `firstname-exercise1.md`.
2. In [Part 1](#part-1) add all your comments, concerns, and creative ideas on our project!
3. For [Part 2](#part-2) and [3](#part-3) please pick out an online Pomodoro app. It can be helpful to see what we like/don't like in the current market. (Also so we can be BETTER).
4. For [Part 4](#part-4), try out the Pomodoro Technique if you haven't already. There are a few questions you can answer if your thoughts aren't in order. 
5. Please bring these ideas to the group meeting to share aloud. If you aren't comfortable with speaking to the group, please upload your responses to `admin/exercises` (aka this current directory) so we can see!

### :tomato: &nbsp; PART 1
Before you forgot them, list all your thoughts and creative ideas on the Pomodoro Timer we will build! Do you want to modify the technique? Do you have specific features in mind? Are there UI components you want to add? If you would prefer to use another tool (e.g. sticky notes, block diagrams), do that!

*Think here*.

### :tomato: &nbsp; PART 2
A bunch of random online Pomodoro timers have been listed. Please choose one (or more) that you would like to study. Add your time next to the claimed timer. Feel free to modify this list if there's a timer I'm missing.

4. Were you asked to log in/create an account?
5. Was it obvious that it was a *Pomodoro* timer? How did you know?

#### Work Session/Pomodoro

2. Was there any **feedback** on your progress? (E.g. bar at top of screen, percentage, time left).
3. Was a clock the main feature? If so, please describe it (e.g. analog). If not, what was the main featue?

2. Were you given the option of (a) skipping a break, (b) short break, (c) long break? Or did you have no choice?

### :tomato: &nbsp; PART 4 (Bonus)
Try the Pomodoro Technique for a day. The traditional Pomodoro Technique is defined as:
```
A Pomodoro is a work session that lasts for 25 minutes.
If a work session is interrupted or paused, it is forfeited.
After a Pomodoro, take a 5 minute break.
Once you have completed 4 Pomodoros--a "set"--take a longer break (15-30 minutes).
```

#### Data
1. How many Pomodoros did you do?
2. Did you cancel/forfeit any Pomodoros? Why?
3. How many short breaks did you take?
4. How many long breaks did you take?
5. How did you time yourself? (E.g. phone clock app or specific Pomodoro app)
6. What device did you use for this timer? (E.g. phone, laptop)

#### Experience
1. Did you initially plan how many Pomodoros you wanted to spend or did you wing it?
2. If you planned the number, was this challenging or easy?
3. Did you feel your productivity increased?
4. Did you use traditional 25 minutes or did you modify that (E.g. 35 minutes)?
5. Would you consider modifying the 25 minutes in the future?
6. Did you feel like you often skipped a break?
7. Did you often extend your break into a longer one?
8. Would you use this technique again?
