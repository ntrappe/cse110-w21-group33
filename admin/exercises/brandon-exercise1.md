# Exercise 1


### :tomato: &nbsp; INSTRUCTIONS
To get prepared for the brainstorming event, this exercise might help to organize your thoughts.
1. **Make a copy** and label it with your name. Example: `firstname-exercise1.md`.
2. In [Part 1](#part-1) add all your comments, concerns, and creative ideas on our project!
3. For [Part 2](#part-2) and [3](#part-3) please pick out an online Pomodoro app. It can be helpful to see what we like/don't like in the current market. (Also so we can be BETTER).
4. For [Part 4](#part-4), try out the Pomodoro Technique if you haven't already. There are a few questions you can answer if your thoughts aren't in order. 
5. Please bring these ideas to the group meeting to share aloud. If you aren't comfortable with speaking to the group, please upload your responses to `admin/exercises` (aka this current directory) so we can see!

### :tomato: &nbsp; PART 1
Before you forgot them, list all your thoughts and creative ideas on the Pomodoro Timer we will build! Do you want to modify the technique? Do you have specific features in mind? Are there UI components you want to add? If you would prefer to use another tool (e.g. sticky notes, block diagrams), do that!

- Basic tasklist at start of day for expected tasks and estimated sessions required
  - If a task is not finished in the expected sessions, do you move on to the next task or continue adding on sessions. Button to indicate that task is finished and record it?
- In order to minimize clutter and enforce working, maybe each long session of work you want to do, once you start the session you only see timers (automatically allocating short or long breaks), only being able to move on to next task until tasks all done.

### :tomato: &nbsp; PART 2
A bunch of random online Pomodoro timers have been listed. Please choose one (or more) that you would like to study. **Add your name** next to the timer you're claiming. I've currently limited each timer to 2 people just so we have an even distribution. Feel free to modify this list if there's a timer I'm missing.

### :tomato: &nbsp; PART 3

#### Setup
1. Was there a prompt to set the number of Pomodoros? No
2. Was there a prompt to set the Pomodoro or break time? Yes, there was a custom timer
3. What options (buttons, fields to enter) were given? (E.g. 'pause' button). Pause, restart, repeat forever, notification sound
4. Were you asked to log in/create an account? No
5. Was it obvious that it was a *Pomodoro* timer? How did you know? Yes, it said pomodoro.

#### Work Session/Pomodoro
1. What **cues** indicated it was Pomodoro/work time? For example, *visual cues* can include a change of color or a label of "work time"; *audio cues* could consist of a ticking noise. Just a timer
2. Was there any **feedback** on your progress? (E.g. bar at top of screen, percentage, time left). Timer, showed what cycle of the technique we were in
3. Was a clock the main feature? If so, please describe it (e.g. analog). If not, what was the main featue? Yes, digital clock
4. Did the interface distract you? (E.g. flashing, bright colors, etc.). Slightly much on the screen, I looked at the custom one to save time instead of waiting the whole 25 minutes and the milliseconds counting down was annoying.
5. Did the interface help you focus? (E.g. silence notifications). No

#### Transition
1. When the app switched from work to break, was there a **color** change? Did you like it? No.
2. When the app switched from work to break, was there a **sound** effect? Did you like it? Small ding. It was fine not jarring
3. How did the app notify you to switch? Did you get a notification? A sound? Something in your browser? Small ding sound

#### Break Session
1. How did you know if it was a short or long break? It showed the section at the bottom.
2. Were you given the option of (a) skipping a break, (b) short break, (c) long break? Or did you have no choice? No choice.
3. What **cues** indicated it was break time? For example, *visual cues* can include a change of color or a label of "break time"; *audio cues* could consist of the sound of ocean waves.

#### End
1. How did you end your session? I clicked out to the main site.
2. Did you see how many Pomodoros you accomplished? If so, how was this provided? No. 

#### Final Thoughts
1. What are 3 pros of this app? It doesn't allow you to change the scheduling of breaks, customizable sound notification, simple to begin.
2. What are 3 cons of this app? Doesn't record tasks and number of pomodoros, you can pause the session, too much to look at 
3. Would you use this app again? No

#### Additional Comments
Add annotations, images, etc.

### :tomato: &nbsp; PART 4 (Bonus)
Try the Pomodoro Technique for a day. The traditional Pomodoro Technique is defined as:
```
A Pomodoro is a work session that lasts for 25 minutes.
If a work session is interrupted or paused, it is forfeited.
After a Pomodoro, take a 5 minute break.
Once you have completed 4 Pomodoros--a "set"--take a longer break (15-30 minutes).
```

#### Data
1. How many Pomodoros did you do?
2. Did you cancel/forfeit any Pomodoros? Why?
3. How many short breaks did you take?
4. How many long breaks did you take?
5. How did you time yourself? (E.g. phone clock app or specific Pomodoro app)
6. What device did you use for this timer? (E.g. phone, laptop)

#### Experience
1. Did you initially plan how many Pomodoros you wanted to spend or did you wing it?
2. If you planned the number, was this challenging or easy?
3. Did you feel your productivity increased?
4. Did you use traditional 25 minutes or did you modify that (E.g. 35 minutes)?
5. Would you consider modifying the 25 minutes in the future?
6. Did you feel like you often skipped a break?
7. Did you often extend your break into a longer one?
8. Would you use this technique again?
9. What are 3 pros?
10. What are 3 cons?
