# Exercise 1


### :tomato: &nbsp; INSTRUCTIONS
To get prepared for the brainstorming event, this exercise might help to organize your thoughts.
1. **Make a copy** and label it with your name. Example: `firstname-exercise1.md`.
2. In [Part 1](#part-1) add all your comments, concerns, and creative ideas on our project!
3. For [Part 2](#part-2) and [3](#part-3) please pick out an online Pomodoro app. It can be helpful to see what we like/don't like in the current market. (Also so we can be BETTER).
4. For [Part 4](#part-4), try out the Pomodoro Technique if you haven't already. There are a few questions you can answer if your thoughts aren't in order. 
5. Please bring these ideas to the group meeting to share aloud. If you aren't comfortable with speaking to the group, please upload your responses to `admin/exercises` (aka this current directory) so we can see!

### :tomato: &nbsp; PART 1
Before you forgot them, list all your thoughts and creative ideas on the Pomodoro Timer we will build! Do you want to modify the technique? Do you have specific features in mind? Are there UI components you want to add? If you would prefer to use another tool (e.g. sticky notes, block diagrams), do that!

I think for the timer, we should aim to have a minimal interface, and have most of the controls hidden away. In addition, I think being able to set custom pomodoro lengths would be nice. For me personally, I like longer work sessions and breaks, as I have trouble transitioning between the two so I'd prefer to work longer and then break for longer. No other ideas for the timer right now.

### :tomato: &nbsp; PART 2
A bunch of random online Pomodoro timers have been listed. Please choose one (or more) that you would like to study. **Add your name** next to the timer you're claiming. I've currently limited each timer to 2 people just so we have an even distribution. Feel free to modify this list if there's a timer I'm missing.

### :tomato: &nbsp; PART 3

#### Setup
1. Was there a prompt to set the number of Pomodoros? Yes, can be listed as tasks.
2. Was there a prompt to set the Pomodoro or break time? No, avaliable in settings.
3. What options (buttons, fields to enter) were given? (E.g. 'pause' button). Yes, Start/Stop.
4. Were you asked to log in/create an account? No, option is avaliable though.
5. Was it obvious that it was a *Pomodoro* timer? How did you know? It is labelled as a Pomodoro timer.

#### Work Session/Pomodoro
1. What **cues** indicated it was Pomodoro/work time? For example, *visual cues* can include a change of color or a label of "work time"; *audio cues* could consist of a ticking noise. Red = Pomodoro; Light Blue = Short Break; Dark Blue = Long Break.
2. Was there any **feedback** on your progress? (E.g. bar at top of screen, percentage, time left). Countdown timer.
3. Was a clock the main feature? If so, please describe it (e.g. analog). If not, what was the main featue? Digital clock was the main feature.
4. Did the interface distract you? (E.g. flashing, bright colors, etc.). No, I shrunk the window.
5. Did the interface help you focus? (E.g. silence notifications). No, not able to do that via web-app.

#### Transition
1. When the app switched from work to break, was there a **color** change? Did you like it? Yes, I don't think it's necessary.
2. When the app switched from work to break, was there a **sound** effect? Did you like it? Yes, that's how I knew the break was starting.
3. How did the app notify you to switch? Did you get a notification? A sound? Something in your browser? There is a sound and app notification.

#### Break Session
1. How did you know if it was a short or long break? It indicates it based on the page color and tab title.
2. Were you given the option of (a) skipping a break, (b) short break, (c) long break? Or did you have no choice? All three are options.
3. What **cues** indicated it was break time? For example, *visual cues* can include a change of color or a label of "break time"; *audio cues* could consist of the sound of ocean waves. All three types, including textl, audio, and a notification.

#### End
1. How did you end your session? I closed the window.
2. Did you see how many Pomodoros you accomplished? If so, how was this provided? I could see the tasks listed.

#### Final Thoughts
1. What are 3 pros of this app? Clean interface, multimedia notifications, variety of settings.
2. What are 3 cons of this app? Color can be distracting, most benefits come from leaving the timer open, paid for full features.
3. Would you use this app again? Yes.

#### Additional Comments
Add annotations, images, etc.

### :tomato: &nbsp; PART 4 (Bonus)
Try the Pomodoro Technique for a day. The traditional Pomodoro Technique is defined as:
```
A Pomodoro is a work session that lasts for 25 minutes.
If a work session is interrupted or paused, it is forfeited.
After a Pomodoro, take a 5 minute break.
Once you have completed 4 Pomodoros--a "set"--take a longer break (15-30 minutes).
```

#### Data
1. How many Pomodoros did you do?
2. Did you cancel/forfeit any Pomodoros? Why?
3. How many short breaks did you take?
4. How many long breaks did you take?
5. How did you time yourself? (E.g. phone clock app or specific Pomodoro app)
6. What device did you use for this timer? (E.g. phone, laptop)

#### Experience
1. Did you initially plan how many Pomodoros you wanted to spend or did you wing it?
2. If you planned the number, was this challenging or easy?
3. Did you feel your productivity increased?
4. Did you use traditional 25 minutes or did you modify that (E.g. 35 minutes)?
5. Would you consider modifying the 25 minutes in the future?
6. Did you feel like you often skipped a break?
7. Did you often extend your break into a longer one?
8. Would you use this technique again?
9. What are 3 pros?
10. What are 3 cons?
