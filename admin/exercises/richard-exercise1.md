# Exercise 1


### :tomato: &nbsp; INSTRUCTIONS
To get prepared for the brainstorming event, this exercise might help to organize your thoughts.
1. **Make a copy** and label it with your name. Example: `firstname-exercise1.md`.
2. In [Part 1](#part-1) add all your comments, concerns, and creative ideas on our project!
3. For [Part 2](#part-2) and [3](#part-3) please pick out an online Pomodoro app. It can be helpful to see what we like/don't like in the current market. (Also so we can be BETTER).
4. For [Part 4](#part-4), try out the Pomodoro Technique if you haven't already. There are a few questions you can answer if your thoughts aren't in order. 
5. Please bring these ideas to the group meeting to share aloud. If you aren't comfortable with speaking to the group, please upload your responses to `admin/exercises` (aka this current directory) so we can see!

### :tomato: &nbsp; PART 1
Before you forgot them, list all your thoughts and creative ideas on the Pomodoro Timer we will build! Do you want to modify the technique? Do you have specific features in mind? Are there UI components you want to add? If you would prefer to use another tool (e.g. sticky notes, block diagrams), do that!

*Objectives/Goals for the day
*ToDo List
*Maybe create an app so we can use the timer on our phones

### :tomato: &nbsp; PART 2
A bunch of random online Pomodoro timers have been listed. Please choose one (or more) that you would like to study. **Add your name** next to the timer you're claiming. I've currently limited each timer to 2 people just so we have an even distribution. Feel free to modify this list if there's a timer I'm missing.

### :tomato: &nbsp; PART 3

#### Setup
1. Was there a prompt to set the number of Pomodoros? 
   * No but there is an option to change the number
2. Was there a prompt to set the Pomodoro or break time? 
   * No but there is an option to change the pomodoro and break time
3. What options (buttons, fields to enter) were given? (E.g. 'pause' button).
   * Start and Stop
4. Were you asked to log in/create an account?
   * No but theres an option to create an account
5. Was it obvious that it was a *Pomodoro* timer? How did you know?
   * Yes because it said Pomodoro-Tracker on the website name

#### Work Session/Pomodoro
1. What **cues** indicated it was Pomodoro/work time? For example, *visual cues* can include a change of color or a label of "work time"; *audio cues* could consist of a ticking noise.
   * When it is working time the timer will be red and when it is break time the timer was green
2. Was there any **feedback** on your progress? (E.g. bar at top of screen, percentage, time left).
   * There was a ticking timer at the top of the page with how long left there is and when work time was up there was a sound
3. Was a clock the main feature? If so, please describe it (e.g. analog). If not, what was the main featue?
   * Yes, the clock was the main feature
4. Did the interface distract you? (E.g. flashing, bright colors, etc.).
   * Not really
5. Did the interface help you focus? (E.g. silence notifications).
   * Yes 

#### Transition
1. When the app switched from work to break, was there a **color** change? Did you like it?
   * Yes there was a color change and I liked it because it is a simple way to figure out whether it is break time or work time
2. When the app switched from work to break, was there a **sound** effect? Did you like it?
   * Yes there was a sound effect and I likeds it because I don't have to pay attention to the timer to know that work time is over or break time is over 
3. How did the app notify you to switch? Did you get a notification? A sound? Something in your browser?
   * A sound

#### Break Session
1. How did you know if it was a short or long break?
   * It would tell me if its a long break or short break but the sound effect is the same
2. Were you given the option of (a) skipping a break, (b) short break, (c) long break? Or did you have no choice?
   * I was given an option to skip a break
3. What **cues** indicated it was break time? For example, *visual cues* can include a change of color or a label of "break time"; *audio cues* could consist of the sound of ocean waves.
   * The color would turn from red to green and there would be a sound effect

#### End
1. How did you end your session?
   * It automatically ended as you had to press START to start each work session
2. Did you see how many Pomodoros you accomplished? If so, how was this provided?
   * Yes, you could see how many Pomodor you accomplsihed and it was under the timer

#### Final Thoughts
1. What are 3 pros of this app?
   * Customization, Adding a description, and how many Pomodoro you finished
2. What are 3 cons of this app?
   * Kind of confusing to understand if you don't know what a Pomodoro timer is, being able to pause the timer, and having to automatically set the pomodoro to auto start
3. Would you use this app again?
   * If I had to use a Pomodoro timer, yes

#### Additional Comments
Add annotations, images, etc.

### :tomato: &nbsp; PART 4 (Bonus)
Try the Pomodoro Technique for a day. The traditional Pomodoro Technique is defined as:
```
A Pomodoro is a work session that lasts for 25 minutes.
If a work session is interrupted or paused, it is forfeited.
After a Pomodoro, take a 5 minute break.
Once you have completed 4 Pomodoros--a "set"--take a longer break (15-30 minutes).
```

#### Data
1. How many Pomodoros did you do?
2. Did you cancel/forfeit any Pomodoros? Why?
3. How many short breaks did you take?
4. How many long breaks did you take?
5. How did you time yourself? (E.g. phone clock app or specific Pomodoro app)
6. What device did you use for this timer? (E.g. phone, laptop)

#### Experience
1. Did you initially plan how many Pomodoros you wanted to spend or did you wing it?
2. If you planned the number, was this challenging or easy?
3. Did you feel your productivity increased?
4. Did you use traditional 25 minutes or did you modify that (E.g. 35 minutes)?
5. Would you consider modifying the 25 minutes in the future?
6. Did you feel like you often skipped a break?
7. Did you often extend your break into a longer one?
8. Would you use this technique again?
9. What are 3 pros?
10. What are 3 cons?
